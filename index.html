            In the world of fashion, it is undeniable that the increasing demand for second-hand clothing has undergone 
            major changes in the past decade. With the emergence of second-hand ecommerce markets, finding unique pieces 
            to add to your closet has become more and more attractive, especially to younger generations. Tackling obstacles, 
            like price-point and sustainability, this trending market is only becoming more normalized. 
        </p>

        <p id="story_para">
            From hair ties to denim jackets and graphic tees, vintage alternatives have a newfound appreciation, and in 
            many instances, are preferable. The phrase “what goes around comes around” denotes the hot demand for fashion 
            cycles that have already seen their debut, but that hasn't stopped them from becoming viral again. 
        </p>

        <p id="story_para">
            While “thrifting” has gained popularity in younger generations, second-hand clothing isn't new. Known for its 
            eclectic culture, San Francisco has been a hotspot for second-hand clothing for decades. While younger generations 
            have coined the hobby as “thrifting”, this term can refer to many different facets of second-hand apparel retail.
        </p>

            Initially, national chains, like Goodwill and Salvation Army served as a social effort to provide lower price 
            alternatives to those in need. These traditional “thrift stores” offer a non-curated selection, creating a less 
            value-saturated collection. Since then this second-hand market has responded to the trendiness of previously 
            owned clothes. 
        </p>

    
        <p id="story_para">
            While these traditional thrifting chains are still thriving, the popularity of buying second-hand has converted 
            from once taboo, to now common. This market expansion has led to curated vintage storefronts popping up in areas 
            across the country, including the Haight Ashbury neighborhood in San Francisco.  Although often referred to as 
            “thrifting”, some second-hand shops sell previously used clothing that is valued far more than some first-hand 
            products. For instance, “vintage-clothing” implies a curated selection, implying a quality of scarcity and 
            therefore value to the clothing (think Levi's jeans, leather jackets, and other newly trending pieces reliant on 
            their brand labels). A “curated” shop, intentionally lists each hand-picked piece to denote the store's aesthetic.

            In addition to a physical, storefront presence, the second-hand market has vastly expanded to the online markets 
            as well, like Depop and ThredUp, two resell sites for thrifting enthusiasts, making sustainable solutions a reality 
            to younger shoppers. “I do think my daughters now are really careful about buying fast fashion,” remarks Deborah 
            Miller, expert appraiser and mother of two, “They brought it up to me, not me to them.” 
        </p>

            This new online model provides an accessible gateway for younger generations to find affordable and unique

            “It's a great price point for them… and they can get great things lightly worn individualizing themselves…
            so maybe it's an aspect of just really wanting to exert your personality more in a sea of sameness…
            It's a great way of exerting your individual sartorial,” said Miller.

        <p id="story_para">
            Since the 1970s, Haight Street has stood as one of San Francisco's most diverse and sought after resale markets.
        </p>

        <p id="story_para">
            The normalization and rational elongation of a textile's lifetime over the past decade or so has enabled high 
            valued brands to be curated by store owners, creating a differentiation between traditional thrifting and 
            curated shops. In this case, the market for second-hand clothing hasn't shifted, but rather expanded to 
            target customers who are willing to pay the price for specialized items. 
        </p>

        <p id="story_para">
            Taylor B., Wasteland inventory manager, gives insight into the past of Wasteland, a now curated, designer 
            resale shop -- one of the many second-hand spots on Haight. “The store is over thirty years old,” tells Taylor. 
            “(The store) started as strictly vintage… but seven, or eight years ago it shifted to more designer.”

            <h2>A Need to Thrift</h2>
        </div>

        <p id="story_para">
            Yvonne Hyatt, a life-long thrifter and recent hire at her local Goodwill started thrifting in 1982 when 
            “it was very cool to buy used vintage clothing and have a very unique style all to yourself. 
            It was really really cheap then, too!” Since then, she's noticed the drastic increase in second-hand clothing 
            prices “all around the board,” as her vintage punk rock clothing has not been partially caused by the shift 
            that Taylor B. mentioned from vintage to designer clothing.
        </p>

        <p id="story_para">
            “I've been thrifty my whole life,” recalls Hannah M., local Haight street regular,  “My parents were lower 
            middle class, so they took (me and my brother) to thrift stores when we were really young to shop for clothes, 
            and they made it pretty fun”. Hannah recalls that after following fast-fashion trends for the majority of her 
            college career, she reverted to shopping second-hand when moved to school.
        </p>

        <p id="story_para">
            “I had an awakening into my own style and just started shopping at thrift stores… I think it's just about 
            wearing clothes that express how you feel inside and like, express your values. So my clothing tends to be 
            very colorful, very bright, and hopefully interesting,” Hannah said. “What I want when I walk down the street 
            is to make other people smile when they look at me,” tells Hannah, “because that's a reflection of my values. 
            I want to exude love into the world, and so that is what I choose to put on my body and it, it means a lot to me.” 
            Due to marked-down prices on secondhand clothing, Hannah is better able to find pieces that suit both her aesthetic 
            and sustainable efforts. Hannah notes, “I wouldn't be able to experiment as much as I do with fashion if I didn't 
            (thrift). It just wouldn't be (financially) sustainable.”

            Although there has been conversation around the ethics of buying secondhand and perhaps taking the supply for 
            those in need, the reality of the fashion industry is that there really is no scarcity. Although the overall 
            demand for secondhand clothing has increased dramatically over the past five years, and therefor risen prices, 
            our interviewees noted that “thats just unfettered capitalism” and that the total supply for those in need hasn't 
            lessened.

        <p id="story_para">
            “I still think thrift stores as they always have been, are a really great equalizer. It really doesn't matter how much income you have or where you come from, like you can walk into a thrift store and come out with a great piece,” Hannah says. 
        </p>

        <p id="story_para">
            A slow-fashion idealist, Hannah uses second-hand shopping as a way to set examples of how to create a sustainable cycle of consumption while also giving back to second-hand stores in order to do her part in the system: “I think that any time that you shop second hand, it's like giving back, it is sustainable, in and of itself. I shop a lot at thrift stores, which means I purchase a lot. But I also try to cycle through my closet pretty often and give away clothes as well to keep the cycle going”. By continuing donating the clothing that no longer has a place in her closet, Hannah continues the cycle for other local thrifters: “The ideal is that people are purchasing from thrift stores, but they're also giving back to thrift stores.” 
        </p>

        <p id="story_para">
            The adaptation to online markets has broadened the scope and outreach of secondhand clothing drastically, but are there other ways in which the industry is still lacking? According to Deborah, men's clothing and plus size clothing is not common to come across in the resell space.
        </p>

        <p id="story_para">
            “That's a weakness of vintage. Nice vintage and nice, you know, designer stuff, it just tends to stop at a certain size.”
        </p>

    
        <p id="story_para">
            In addition to a variety of diverse collections, the resell spaces may also be lacking in giving back to their communities. Hannah hopes to see a cycle of profit that transparently benefits the surrounding community,so that each shop “is really part of the neighborhood”, while also sees a future in the idea of large-scale normalization of everyday wear. “Like people who live next door(would)curate their closets from the surrounding area, and sell it to you. It(would be) taking (the clothing cycle) out from the global ecosystem and making it very grassroots and community based.”  
        </p>

        <p id="story_para">
            The destructively rapid cycle of clothing we have normalized continues to play an appalling role in the worsening of our environment. With each new cycle, our once “trendy” pieces are less and less able to withstand timeless looks, and increasingly easy to dispose of. Although many new alternative models of the textile industry have made an appearance, will humans ever realize that there is already enough clothing on this planet.
